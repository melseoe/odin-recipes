    <center><h3>Instructions</h3></center>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the grape leaves: If you're using preserved grape leaves, rinse them well to remove excess brine. If using fresh grape leaves, blanch them in boiling water for about 2-3 minutes to soften. Drain them and set aside.</li><br>
        <li><p>Prepare the filling:
            Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
            <br>
            Add the ground meat (if using) and cook until browned. Then add the washed rice and stir for 2-3 minutes.
            <br>
            Add the paprika, dried mint, thyme (or oregano), salt, pepper, pine nuts, and currants (if using). Stir everything together.
            <br>
            Add about 1/2 cup of water and the lemon zest and juice. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the rice is partially cooked (the rice doesn't need to be fully cooked at this point as it will continue to cook inside the grape leaves).
            <br>
            Remove from heat and let the filling cool slightly.</p></li><br>
        <li><p>Stuff the grape leaves:
            Lay a grape leaf flat on a clean surface, vein side up. Place a spoonful of the filling near the stem end of the leaf. Be careful not to overfill.
            <br>
            Fold the sides of the grape leaf over the filling, then tightly roll it up, ensuring it is snug but not too tight (as the rice will expand during cooking). Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.</li></p><br>
        <li><p>Arrange the sarma:
            In a large, deep pot, layer the stuffed grape leaves tightly in a spiral or concentric circles. Place a couple of slices of lemon on top for extra flavor, and drizzle some olive oil over the top.
            <br>
            Once all the sarma are arranged, pour enough water (or broth) to cover the rolls. Add the lemon juice and cover with a lid. If you want, you can place a heavy plate or a lid on top to keep the rolls submerged.</li></p><br>
        <li><p>Cook the sarma:
            Bring the pot to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the rice is tender and the sarma are fully cooked. Check the water level and add more if necessary to keep them covered.</li></p><br>
        <li>Let the sarma rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with a side of yogurt.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>Enjoy your Sarma! It's a delicious and comforting dish that's perfect for family gatherings!</p>
