    <center><h3>Instructions</h3></center>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the peppers:
            Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds carefully, leaving the peppers intact. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li><p>Prepare the filling:
            In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.            
            <br>
            Add the ground meat and cook until browned.
            <br>
            Stir in the rice, paprika, dried mint, thyme, pine nuts (if using), and currants (if using). Season with salt and pepper.
            <br>
            Add the grated tomatoes, tomato paste (if using), and a small amount of water (about 1/4 cup) to help the rice cook. Simmer for about 5-7 minutes, just enough to soften the rice slightly but not fully cook it.
            <br>
            Stir in the fresh parsley and lemon juice. Remove from heat and allow the filling to cool slightly.</p></li><br>
        <li><p>Stuff the peppers:
            Carefully stuff each pepper with the filling, pressing it down gently to ensure it's packed. Leave a little room at the top for the rice to expand during cooking. Repeat with the remaining peppers.</li></p><br>
        <li><p>Arrange the dolmas:
            Place the stuffed peppers in a large pot, standing them up tightly against each other.
            <br>
            Drizzle the stuffed peppers with olive oil and add water (or broth) to cover the peppers about halfway. You can add a slice of lemon on top for extra flavor.
            <br>
            Place a heavy plate or lid on top to keep the peppers submerged during cooking.</li></p><br>
        <li><p>Cook the dolmas:
            Bring the pot to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for about 45-60 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the rice inside is fully cooked.</li></p><br>
        <li>Let the dolmas rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Serve warm with a side of yogurt for added richness.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>Enjoy your Dolma! A delicious and satisfying dish that brings comfort and warmth to any meal!</p>
